# Arithemetic Operators

# print(x - y)
# print(x + y)
# print(x * y)
# print(x ** y)

# Assignment Operators

# Comperison Operators

# Conditional Statement
if val == num1:

# Logical Operators

check = x > 10 or x > 5
check2 = not(x > 10 and x > 5)

# print(check)
# print(check2)

# Identity Operators are use to compare object

list1 = [10,20,30]
list2 = [10,20,30,"banana"]
# print(list1 is list2)
# print(list1 is not list2)

# Membership operators are used to check if a squence is present in an object

# print(x in list1)
# print(10 in list2)
# print([10,20,30] in list2)
# print("banana" in list2)

# Bitwise operators are used to compare binary numbers
